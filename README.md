# RobinLe's C++ Sources for Windows
## General
Welcome to my GitHub account! I'm a selftaught hobby C++ developer. For the most part, I'm creating platform dependent code for Microsoft Windows (64 bit).

## Executable downloads
Since my repos are the home of multiple unrelated applications and the GitHub release feed is designed for this, I outsourced downloads of executables to my own website.

[Download executables here](https://download.robinle.de/github/)


## Programming languages
All the public repos are written in C/C++.
### Programming languages I have experience with
| Language | Experience level                |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| C        | Experienced (1 semester)        |
| C++      | Very experienced (self-taught)  |
| C#       | Experienced (vocational school) |
| Delphi   | Very experienced (workplace)    |
| Java     | Experienced (1 semester)        |
| NASM x86 | Basics (1 semester)             |


## Platform (C++)
| Category     | Product                                    |

| C++ standard | Latest (currently C++20)                   |


## Themes

### ðŸ“š Libraries
I prefer writing my own code to using someone else's code. That's why I write my own libraries, e.g. for simple graphics applications or audio output.

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [rlPixelWindow](https://github.com/RobinLe1402/rlPixelWindow) | A simple, bitmap-based graphics window. |
| [rlUnits](https://github.com/RobinLe1402/libs) | Many small functions. Will be removed/renamed in the future. |

### ðŸ›  Tools
I sometimes create small tools for everyday use. These can be found in the `tools` repository.

### ðŸŽ® Games
Another thing I like to develope are games. I haven't finished any game yet, but in the moment I'm working on a new code base (--> `libs` repository) after abondoning my old header library (currently private). But once I'm finished with creating a solid base, I'll start with some game. Probably either a NES-style game, or a simple PNG-based 2D game, as I have no experience whatsoever with 3D graphics.

OpenGL is the graphics API of my choice. Why? Well, I never tried anything else and I'm fine with it ðŸ˜…

I've also created an audio engine based on Microsoft's most modern audio API, XAudio2.
