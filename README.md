# RobinLe's C++ Sources for Windows
## General
Welcome to my GitHub account! I'm a selftaught hobby C++ developer. For the most part, I'm creating platform dependent code for Microsoft Windows (32/64 bit).

## Programming languages
* C++ ♥ (in my free time)
* Delphi 👍 (in my job)
* C# 🤏 (just from vocational school)



## Themes

### 🛠 Tools
I sometimes create small tools for everyday use. These can be found in the `tools` repository.

### 🎮 Games
Another thing I like to develope are games. I haven't finished any game yet, but in the moment I'm working on a new code base (--> `libs` repository) after abondoning my old header library (currently private). But once I'm finished with creating a solid base, I'll start with some game. Probably either a NES-style game, or a simple PNG-based 2D game, as I have no experience whatsoever with 3D graphics.

OpenGL is the graphics API of my choice. Why? Well, I never tried anything else and I'm fine with it 😅

I've created an audio engine based on Microsoft's most modern audio API, XAudio2. It can be found here: [HPP](../../../libs/blob/main/src/rlAudioEngine.hpp), [CPP](../../../libs/blob/main/src/rlAudioEngine.cpp), [Documentation](../../../libs/wiki/Component:-rlAudioEngine)
