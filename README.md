# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
Welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Robin and I'm a hobby C++ and web developer.

## ‚ùì What I Do
I create...
* [üìö dynamic libraries](https://github.com/stars/RobinLe1402/lists/dynamic-libraries) (`.dll` files)
* [üìö static libraries](https://github.com/stars/RobinLe1402/lists/static-libraries) (`.lib` files)
* [üõ†Ô∏è tools](https://github.com/stars/RobinLe1402/lists/tools) (applications)
* [üéÆ video games](https://github.com/stars/RobinLe1402/lists/games)
* [üåê websites](https://github.com/stars/RobinLe1402/lists/websites)

I always liked thinking about myself as a game developer, as I always wanted to program a game.
However, after a few years, it seems to me that I'm more of a general programmer, as I put a lot of
efford and time into creating all those basic projects like a
[text (file/data) decoder](https://rle.sh/git/rlText), a
[bitmap-based "graphics engine"](https://rle.sh/git/rlPixelWindow), or a
[JSON interface](https://rle.shh/git/rlJSON).
However, the ultimate goal is still creating video games. Most likely non-commercial ones, as I
don't want to deal with all those business responsibilities. I'm always telling myself I'm just
creating all that stuff because I first want a solid base for my game (I really, **really** dislike
using other people's libraries - I prefer writing it myself, no matter what it is).

With websites, it all started with my homepage [`robinle.net`](https://www.robinle.net)
(previously `robinle.de`). After re-coding it from the ground up in 2023, I started coding other
websites, too. Like [`stickerbush-symphony.de`](https://www.stickerbush-symphony.de), a domain I had
owned for years but didn't really have enough knowledge to implement more professionally. But after
the new version of my homepage went live, I overhauled it a little.
My probably biggest web development project is my own video streaming page,
[`robinle.tv`](https://www.robinle.tv) (which is still WiP). And I only did that because I did not
want to support YouTube/Google anymore.





# Software Development (C/C++)

## üñ• Target Platform
All my public repos consist of C/C++ code (I'm usually working with the most recent C++ standard)
within [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) solutions.

Unless noted otherwise, my code is written for Microsoft Windows (64 bit). I myself use Windows
10/11 and don't really test for compatibility with other operating systems.


## üìÑ My Code Guidelines
I created a guideline document for my C/C++ code, it can be found [here](/CodeGuidelines.md).


## ü§ù License
You can use my code for your own projects! Just make sure to apply my
[license terms](LicenseInfo.md).


## üíæ External Executable Downloads
Since my old repos ([`libs`](https://rle.sh/git/libs) and [`tools`](https://rle.sh/git/tools)) were the home of multiple unrelated applications/libraries
and the GitHub release
feed isn't really designed for this, I outsourced downloads for these repositories to my own website.
[Download them here](https://download.robinle.net/github)





# Web Development (PHP/Javascript)
My main website is [robinle.net](https://www.robinle.net).

It also contains a [list of websites I created](https://www.robinle.net/websites).
