# RobinLe's C++ Sources for Windows

> [!WARNING]
> I'm currently changing the structure of my repositories. Repositories/files may be deleted or renamed at any point in time.

## General
### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
Welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Robin and I'm a selftaught hobby C++ developer.

### üñ• Target Platform
All my public repos consist of C/C++ code (I'm usually working with the most recent C++ standard) within [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) solutions.

Unless noted otherwise, my code is written for Microsoft Windows (64 bit). I myself use Windows 10/11 and don't really test for compatibility with other operating systems.

### My Code Guidelines
I created a guideline document for my C/C++ code, it can be found [here](/CodeGuidelines.md).

### License
You can use my code for your own projects! Just make sure to apply my [license terms](LicenseInfo.md).

### ‚¨á External executable downloads
Since my old repos are the home of multiple unrelated applications/libraries and the GitHub release feed isn't really designed for this, I outsourced downloads of executables to my own website.
[Download executables here](https://download.robinle.de/github/)



## Repos
I prefer writing my own code to using someone else's code. That's why I usually write my own libraries.

### üìö Dynamic Libraries (`.dll` files)
I already created a few DLLs, but I'll only list them here once I'm done with the restructuring of my GitHub account.

### üìö Static Libraries (`.lib` files)
These are created for general use in any type of application (but primarily for my own projects).

| [rlInput](https://rle.sh/git/rlInput)             | Unified interface for keyboard, mouse and gamepads.          |
| [rlJSON](https://rle.sh/git/rlJSON)               | A JSON file parser and writer.                               |
| [rlPixelWindow](https://rle.sh/git/rlPixelWindow) | [WiP] A simple, bitmap-based graphics window.                |
| [rlText](https://rle.sh/git/rlText)               | Encode and decode text files.                                |
| [rlUnits](https://rle.sh/git/libs)                | Many small functions. Will be removed/renamed in the future. |

### üéÆ Games
I'm yet to actually create a game, but that's the ultimate goal of this whole GitHub account. As soon as I have everything I need, I'll start with creating a game. Probably either a NES-style game, or a simple PNG-based 2D game, as I have no experience whatsoever with 3D graphics.

I use OpenGL for video output and XAudio2 for audio output.

### üåê Websites
I own many domains, and I'm creating all the correlating websites myself, from the ground up (except for the standard PHP libraries).
But most of my website repositories are private for security reasons (and because I don't want to embarrass myselfüòÖ).
